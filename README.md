### üìñ Manual

### ‚ö° How to create environments/simulations
You can easily create your environments in a totally easy and visual way. You can choose the difficulty of the Invasion. Among the three available difficulties the harder the more protection. In hard mode the hack is more complex and the environment uses high tech protections to defend itself from your simulated attacks. By clicking on any of the difficulty buttons, Sandwhiteleaf will create the environment.
